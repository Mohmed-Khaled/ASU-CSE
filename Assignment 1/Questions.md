Q1.  A class is a programming construct that defines the common state and behavior of a group of similar objects.
***
Q2.  A class design attempts to separate the public interface from the specifics of the implementation. The public interface represents the abstraction component of the design. Gathering the implementation details together and separating them from the abstraction is called encapsulation. Data hiding (putting data into the private section of a class) is an instance of encapsulation, and so is hiding functional details of an implementation in the private section.
***
Q3.  An object is an instance of a class.
***
Q4.  Data members describe the state on an object (instance of a class) but function members describe it’s behavior.
***
Q6.  Constructors are called when an instance of a class is created, destructors are called when an instance of class is removed from memory.
***
Q8.  A default constructor is a constructor that is used to create an object when you don’t provide explicit initialization values and is called with no arguments.
***
Q10. The this pointer is set to the address of the evoking object,so *this is an alias for the object itself.
